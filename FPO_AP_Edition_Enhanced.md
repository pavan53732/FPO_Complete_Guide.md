**Troubleshooting: If MeeBhoomi Access Not Working**

```
PROBLEM 1: Aadhaar OTP not received
SOLUTION:
- Check phone number linked to Aadhaar (call 1947 to verify)
- Try alternative login (Voter ID)
- Visit: Nearest CSC (Common Service Center) - they have offline access

PROBLEM 2: Survey number not found
SOLUTION:
- Check survey number spelling (should match land documents exactly)
- Verify village name is correct
- Visit: MRO office to confirm correct survey number
- Note: Very old or newly subdivided plots may have old survey numbers

PROBLEM 3: Website not loading / Very slow
SOLUTION:
- Try alternative URL: https://ap-agros.com (sometimes mirrors MeeBhoomi)
- Use mobile app instead of browser
- Visit during off-peak hours (early morning / late evening)
- Go to CSC or Internet cafe (they have better connectivity)

PROBLEM 4: Record shows different owner than expected
SOLUTION:
- Land may be in someone else's name legally
- Check: Is there a family dispute or incomplete transfer?
- Visit: MRO to clarify ownership history
- Get: Mutation certificate if name should be changed

PROBLEM 5: "No digitized record" message
SOLUTION:
- Land may be in remote area not yet digitalized
- Get manual copy from MRO office (physical 1B)
- Request: MRO to digitalize (usually fast-tracked)
- Workaround: Use Pattadar Passbook as interim proof

STEP 2: IDENTIFY LEGAL HEIR
Legal heir is typically (in order of priority):

4. Siblings (if no above)

Proof required:
- Death certificate (shows deceased's legal heirs)

STEP 4: OPTION A - IF HEIR CONTINUES MEMBERSHIP

If eligible → Board approves

```

---

### PART D: DISPUTE RESOLUTION (Share-Related)

**What If Heir Disagrees or There's Conflict?**

```
SCENARIO 1: Family disputes who the legal heir is
RESOLUTION:
- Get succession certificate from district court
- OR submit family agreement (signed by all potential heirs) + notarization
- FPO holds shares pending resolution (typically 90 days)
- Legal heirs must resolve externally, not FPO's role

SCENARIO 2: Heir rejects membership but other family members want to join
RESOLUTION:
- If "one member per family" rule applies, can't have multiple
- Family must choose 1 representative
- Others can join FPO only if separate ration cards

SCENARIO 3: Heir wants to continue but not eligible (not farmer)
RESOLUTION:
- Heir can keep shares but can't participate actively
- Shares become "non-participating" (draw dividends only)
- OR heir must sell shares to eligible member
- 60-day deadline to either convert or sell

## ANNEX-6: TELUGU LANGUAGE FARMER HANDOUTS ✨

### ONE-PAGE HANDOUT 1: WHAT IS AN FPO? (Simple Telugu)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
సంगీకృత కృషक సంస్థ (FPO) ఎంటిది?
FARMER PRODUCER ORGANIZATION - సులభ వివరణ
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FPO అంటే: సంगీకృత కృషక సంస్థ (ఒకే ఆలోచనలో ఉన్న రైతుల సమూహం)

🌾 కన్నీ తెలిపే ఉదాహరణ:

ఒంటరిగా చేసిన ఏమీ చేయలేము, కానీ కలిసి చేయగలం.

- ఒంటరి రైతు = తక్కువ ధర, ఎక్కువ సమస్యలు
- [DrawBox] కలిసిన FPO = ఎక్కువ ధర, తక్కువ సమస్యలు

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FPO లాభాలు (సమూహం ఎందుకు మంచిది?):

1. 🛒 సమ్మిళిత కొనుగోలు (Joint Buying)
   - విత్తనాలు, సారాలు, రసాయనాలు చేప ధరకు కొనండి
   - ఏకరుడు కొంటే: ₹1,200/20 కిలోలు
   - FPO ద్వారా కొంటే: ₹900/20 కిలోలు = ₹300 సేవ!

2. 💰 సరిపోయిన ధర (Fair Price)
   - మీ పంటను నేరుగా విక్రయించండి (మధ్యస్తుడు లేకుండా)
   - మార్కెట్ ధర: ₹2,500/100 కిలోలు
   - మధ్యస్థ నష్టం: ₹500
   - FPO నుండి: ₹2,300/100 కిలోలు = రేకీ మీకు!

3. 🚜 ఉపయోగపడే సేవలు
   - ట్రాక్టర్ కూడిక కిరాయిపై
   - తిరిగిపంట పరीక్ష
   - ప్రక్రియాభిరుచి (ఉదా: అరిసి యంత్రం)

4. 💳 ఋణ సువిధలు
   - ఋణాలు పొందటం సులభమైనది (ఎక్కువ మందితుల ధర కారణంగా)
   - కిమర్ చే కవరేజ్ బీమా

5. 🎓 శిక్షణ & జ్ఞానం
   - ఫసలు సంరక్షణ కోర్సు
   - ఆధুనిక వ్యవసాయ పద్ధతులు
   - చెడు వాతావరణానికి సిద్ధమని

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FPO లో చేరటానికి ఎవరు అర్హులు?

✅ చేర్చుకోవచ్చు:
- సక్రియ రైతులు
- నిజమైన భూమి రికార్డ్‌లు ఉన్నవారు
- గోపాల రైతులు (పశువుల పెంపకం)
- 18+ ఏళ్ల వయస్సు

❌ చేర్చుకోలేరు:
- నకిలీ భూమి రికార్డ్‌లు
- తీవ్ర నేమిక కేసులు
- బిజిసం చేసే వ్యాపారులు
- గిరిజన నుండి చేరుకున్న వారు

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

"ఒక కుటుంబం = ఒక సభ్యుడు" నియమం

ఇందర్నీ నిఘంటువు? = ఒక కుటుంబానికి ఒకే ఒక సభ్యుడు FPOలో ఉండాలి

✅ తండ్రి చేరుకోవచ్చు = తనకు కూటమి:
✅ కుమారుడు చేరుకోవచ్చు = కూటమి వేరుగా ఉంటే

❌ తండ్రి & కుమారుడు ఇద్దరూ చేరలేరు = ఒకే కూటమిలో

= ఎందుకంటే: ఒక రాషన్ కార్డ్ = ఒక కుటుంబం

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

సభ్యుడిలో చేరటానికి ఏ పత్రాలు వద్దు?

1. ✅ ఆధార్ కార్డ్
2. ✅ రేషన్ కార్డ్
3. ✅ భూమి రికార్డ్ (ROR-1B / Adangal) - MeeBhoomi నుండి కూడా
4. ✅ బ్యాంక్ పասు
5. ✅ చెక్ కుటుంబ ఫోటోను

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

మీరు చేసిన అధ్యక్షుడుకు ప్రశ్నలు?

Q: FPOలో చేర్చుకోవటానికి ఎంత డబ్బు వెచ్చించాలి?
A: సభ్యులు సంఖ్య = ₹100-200 (ఒకసారిగా), ఎప్పటికీ అదిపోకుండా
   ఇతర సేవలకు చెల్లింపు = సీక్షణ తర్వాత మాత్రమే

Q: FPOకు వెళ్ళటానికి ఏ నిబంధనలున్నాయి?
A: సభ్యులను నిమిషానికి నిర్ణయించుకోలేదు.
   తప్పిపోయిన విషయానికీ చెప్పటానికి FPO అధ్యక్షుడిని సంప్రదించండి.

Q: లాభాలు ఎప్పుడు వస్తాయి?
A: సంవత్సరానికి ఒకసారి (వార్షిక సమావేశం తర్వాత లాభం చెప్పబడుతుంది)
