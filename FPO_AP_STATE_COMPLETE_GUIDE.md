### 🚫 **Top 10 Document Rejection Reasons in Andhra Pradesh**

**CRITICAL: These are the most common reasons FPO member documents get rejected by banks, SFAC, and NABARD. Check each member's documents against this list before submission.**

```
1. Survey number mismatch between Aadhaar & 1B
   - Problem: Survey number on ROR-1B doesn't match Aadhaar address
   - Solution: Get corrected ROR-1B from MRO or update Aadhaar address

2. Ration card address showing different village
   - Problem: Ration card shows different village than FPO location
   - Solution: Get new ration card with correct address OR get address change certificate

3. Old landowner name still appearing on 1B
   - Problem: Land transferred but ROR-1B not updated (mutation pending)
   - Solution: Complete mutation process at MRO office, get updated ROR-1B

4. Multiple owners but only one signature in lease deed
   - Problem: Joint ownership but lease deed signed by only one owner
   - Solution: All owners must sign lease deed OR get NOC from other owners

5. Lease deed not notarized
   - Problem: Lease deed without notary stamp (banks/SFAC prefer notarized)
   - Solution: Get lease deed notarized (₹100-200 cost, worth it)

6. Dairy proof less than 1-month old (needs 3+ months history)
   - Problem: Milk receipts or dairy agreement too recent
   - Solution: Wait until 3+ months of milk supply history OR get older receipts

7. Milk receipts not in member's name
   - Problem: Milk receipts show different name (father's name, nickname)
   - Solution: Get dairy to issue receipts in correct name matching Aadhaar

8. Tenant name not entered in ROR (no tenancy record)
   - Problem: Tenant farmer but ROR-1B doesn't show tenant name
   - Solution: Get MRO certificate confirming tenancy OR register tenancy

9. Veterinary certificate older than 6 months
   - Problem: Livestock registration certificate too old
   - Solution: Get fresh veterinary certificate (valid for 6 months)

10. Land mortgaged to bank without NOC
    - Problem: ROR-1B shows mortgage but no NOC from bank
    - Solution: Get No Objection Certificate (NOC) from bank allowing FPO membership
```

**PREVENTION TIP:** Always verify documents against this checklist before submitting to banks/SFAC/NABARD. This prevents 80% of rejections.

**Note:** *Minimum Monthly Revenue Required = EMI × 2 (to cover EMI + operating expenses + buffer)

**EMI Calculation Formula:**
```
EMI = [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N - 1]
Where:
P = Principal (Loan Amount)
R = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate ÷ 12)
N = Number of Monthly Installments
```

**Example Calculation for ₹10 Lakh @ 9% for 5 years:**
- P = ₹10,00,000
- R = 9% ÷ 12 = 0.75% = 0.0075
- N = 5 × 12 = 60 months
- EMI = [10,00,000 × 0.0075 × (1.0075)^60] / [(1.0075)^60 - 1] = ₹20,758

**CRITICAL: FPO must generate sufficient revenue to cover EMI payments. Use this table to plan loan repayment.**

**Realistic Financial Projection for FPO Milk Business:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MILK COLLECTION BUSINESS - EARNINGS SIMULATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

DAILY OPERATIONS:
├─ Milk Collected: 600 liters/day
├─ Purchase Price (from farmers): ₹34 per liter
├─ Selling Price (to dairy): ₹36 per liter
└─ Margin per liter: ₹2

DAILY PROFIT CALCULATION:
├─ Daily Collection: 600 liters
├─ Daily Revenue: 600 × ₹36 = ₹21,600
├─ Daily Cost: 600 × ₹34 = ₹20,400
└─ Daily Profit: ₹21,600 - ₹20,400 = ₹1,200

MONTHLY PROFIT (30 days):
├─ Monthly Collection: 600 × 30 = 18,000 liters
├─ Monthly Revenue: 18,000 × ₹36 = ₹6,48,000
├─ Monthly Cost: 18,000 × ₹34 = ₹6,12,000
└─ Monthly Profit: ₹6,48,000 - ₹6,12,000 = ₹36,000

YEARLY PROFIT (365 days):
├─ Yearly Collection: 600 × 365 = 2,19,000 liters
├─ Yearly Revenue: 2,19,000 × ₹36 = ₹78,84,000
├─ Yearly Cost: 2,19,000 × ₹34 = ₹74,46,000
└─ Yearly Profit: ₹78,84,000 - ₹74,46,000 = ₹4,38,000

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

KEY ASSUMPTIONS:
├─ Operating days: 365 days/year (year-round supply)
├─ Average daily collection: 600 liters (stable supply)
├─ Purchase margin: ₹2 per liter (standard FPO margin)
└─ No major price fluctuations (stable market)

**Purpose:** Understand impact of price/volume changes on profitability.

**Scenario Analysis:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: IMPACT OF PRICE DROP
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BASE CASE (Current):
────────────────────
Milk Price: ₹35/liter
Milk Volume: 10,000 liters/month
Revenue: ₹35 × 10,000 = ₹3.5 lakh/month

SCENARIO 1: Price Drop 10%
──────────────────────────
Milk Price: ₹31.50/liter (10% drop)
Milk Volume: 10,000 liters/month
Revenue: ₹31.50 × 10,000 = ₹3.15 lakh/month
Impact: -₹35,000/month (-10%)

SCENARIO 2: Price Drop 20%
──────────────────────────
Milk Price: ₹28/liter (20% drop)
Milk Volume: 10,000 liters/month
Revenue: ₹28 × 10,000 = ₹2.8 lakh/month
Impact: -₹70,000/month (-20%)

SCENARIO 3: Volume Drop 20% (Price Same)
─────────────────────────────────────────
Milk Price: ₹35/liter
Milk Volume: 8,000 liters/month (20% drop)
Revenue: ₹35 × 8,000 = ₹2.8 lakh/month
Impact: -₹70,000/month (-20%)

SCENARIO 4: Combined (Price -10%, Volume -10%)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Milk Price: ₹31.50/liter
Milk Volume: 9,000 liters/month
Revenue: ₹31.50 × 9,000 = ₹2.835 lakh/month
Impact: -₹66,500/month (-19%)

### Financial Model 3: ROI Calculator for Machinery Investment

**Purpose:** Calculate return on investment for equipment purchases (tractor, thresher, etc.).

**ROI Calculation Template:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROI CALCULATOR: TRACTOR INVESTMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

INVESTMENT DETAILS:
───────────────────
Tractor Cost: ₹7,00,000
Subsidy (50%): ₹3,50,000
Net Investment: ₹3,50,000
Useful Life: 10 years
Depreciation: ₹35,000/year (straight-line)

ANNUAL REVENUE:
───────────────
Rental Rate: ₹700/hour
Usage: 400 hours/year
Annual Revenue: ₹700 × 400 = ₹2,80,000

ANNUAL EXPENSES:
────────────────
Fuel: ₹1,20,000
Maintenance: ₹40,000
Driver Salary: ₹1,80,000
Insurance: ₹5,000
Depreciation: ₹35,000
TOTAL EXPENSES: ₹3,80,000

ANNUAL PROFIT/LOSS:
───────────────────
Revenue: ₹2,80,000
Expenses: ₹3,80,000
Net Loss: -₹1,00,000 (Year 1)

BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS:
────────────────────
Break-Even Hours = Total Expenses ÷ Rental Rate
Break-Even Hours = ₹3,80,000 ÷ ₹700 = 543 hours/year

RECOMMENDATION:
───────────────
❌ NOT VIABLE at current usage (400 hours)
✅ VIABLE if usage increases to 600+ hours/year
✅ OR if rental rate increases to ₹950/hour

PAYBACK PERIOD:
───────────────
If Annual Profit = ₹1,00,000 (after break-even)
Payback Period = Investment ÷ Annual Profit
Payback Period = ₹3,50,000 ÷ ₹1,00,000 = 3.5 years

ROI (Return on Investment):
───────────────────────────
ROI = (Annual Profit ÷ Investment) × 100
ROI = (₹1,00,000 ÷ ₹3,50,000) × 100 = 28.6% per year
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Excel Formulas:**
- Break-Even = Fixed Costs ÷ (Price - Variable Cost per Unit)
- Payback Period = Initial Investment ÷ Annual Cash Flow
- ROI = (Net Profit ÷ Investment) × 100
- NPV = Use Excel's NPV function for discounted cash flow

### Financial Model 5: Break-Even Analysis

**Purpose:** Determine minimum revenue needed to cover all costs.

**Break-Even Calculation:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FIXED COSTS (Annual):
─────────────────────
Salaries: ₹3,60,000
Rent: ₹48,000
Utilities: ₹24,000
Insurance: ₹12,000
Depreciation: ₹50,000
Other fixed: ₹30,000
TOTAL FIXED COSTS: ₹5,24,000

VARIABLE COSTS (Per Unit):
──────────────────────────
Milk Collection:
- Cost per liter: ₹2
- Selling price per liter: ₹35
- Contribution margin: ₹33 per liter

Paddy Aggregation:
- Cost per quintal: ₹50
- Selling price per quintal: ₹2,500
- Contribution margin: ₹2,450 per quintal

BREAK-EVEN CALCULATION:
───────────────────────
Option 1: Milk Only
Break-Even Liters = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution Margin
Break-Even = ₹5,24,000 ÷ ₹33 = 15,879 liters/year
Break-Even = 1,323 liters/month

Option 2: Paddy Only
Break-Even Quintals = ₹5,24,000 ÷ ₹2,450 = 214 quintals/year
Break-Even = 18 quintals/month

Option 3: Mixed (70% Milk, 30% Paddy)
Weighted Contribution Margin = (0.7 × ₹33) + (0.3 × ₹2,450/100)
= ₹23.10 + ₹7.35 = ₹30.45 per unit
Break-Even Units = ₹5,24,000 ÷ ₹30.45 = 17,208 units/year

MARGIN OF SAFETY:
─────────────────
Current Sales: ₹43.5 lakh/year
Break-Even Sales: ₹5.24 lakh/year (fixed costs)
Margin of Safety = (Current - Break-Even) ÷ Current × 100
Margin of Safety = (43.5 - 5.24) ÷ 43.5 × 100 = 88%

INTERPRETATION:
───────────────
✅ FPO is well above break-even (88% margin of safety)
✅ Can withstand 88% drop in sales before losses
✅ Strong financial position
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Excel Template:**
- Create break-even calculator
- Use Goal Seek for "what-if" analysis
- Visualize with break-even chart
- Calculate margin of safety

#### **Statement 5: Break-Even Point Calculator**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
BREAK-EVEN POINT CALCULATOR
[FPO NAME] FARMER PRODUCER COMPANY LIMITED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FIXED COSTS (Annual):
─────────────────────
- Salaries: ₹3,60,000
- Rent: ₹48,000
- Utilities: ₹24,000
- Insurance: ₹12,000
- Depreciation: ₹50,000
- Other Fixed: ₹30,000
TOTAL FIXED COSTS: ₹5,24,000

VARIABLE COSTS (Per Unit):
──────────────────────────
- Milk: ₹18 per liter (purchase + processing)
- Paddy: ₹1,800 per quintal (purchase + handling)
- Input Supply: 85% of selling price (15% margin)

SELLING PRICES:
───────────────
- Milk: ₹35 per liter
- Paddy: ₹2,500 per quintal
- Inputs: Cost + 15% margin

CONTRIBUTION MARGIN:
────────────────────
- Milk: ₹35 - ₹18 = ₹17 per liter
- Paddy: ₹2,500 - ₹1,800 = ₹700 per quintal

BREAK-EVEN CALCULATION:
───────────────────────
Option 1: Milk Only
Break-Even Liters = ₹5,24,000 ÷ ₹17 = 30,824 liters/year
Break-Even = 2,569 liters/month

Option 2: Paddy Only
Break-Even Quintals = ₹5,24,000 ÷ ₹700 = 749 quintals/year
Break-Even = 62 quintals/month

Option 3: Mixed (60% Milk, 40% Paddy)
Weighted Contribution = (0.6 × ₹17) + (0.4 × ₹700/100)
= ₹10.20 + ₹2.80 = ₹13 per unit
Break-Even Units = ₹5,24,000 ÷ ₹13 = 40,308 units/year

MARGIN OF SAFETY:
─────────────────
Current Sales: ₹45,60,000/year
Break-Even Sales: ₹5,24,000/year
Margin of Safety = (45,60,000 - 5,24,000) ÷ 45,60,000 × 100 = 88.5%

INTERPRETATION:
───────────────
✅ FPO is well above break-even (88.5% margin of safety)
✅ Can withstand significant sales drop before losses
✅ Strong financial position

### 13.9. FAQ & TROUBLESHOOTING

**Q1: What if I can't find 10 farmers from different families?**
A: You can start with 10 members from nearby villages in the same mandal/district. The key requirement is "different families" (different ration cards), not necessarily same village.

**Q2: Can I change the FPO name after registration?**
A: Yes, but it requires board resolution, member approval, and filing with ROC. It's easier to choose the right name initially.

**Q3: What if a member wants to leave after registration?**
A: Members can exit with 30 days notice. Shares are refunded. FPO must maintain minimum 10 members, so recruit replacement before member exits.

**Q4: How long does registration take?**
A: Typically 6-8 weeks from start to finish (gathering documents → ROC approval → bank account).

**Q5: What if ROC rejects the application?**
A: ROC will provide reasons. Common issues: Name similarity, incomplete documents, incorrect MOA/AOA. Fix issues and resubmit within 30 days.

**Q6: Can FPO have multiple bank accounts?**
A: Yes, FPO can have multiple accounts (e.g., one for operations, one for subsidies). All require board resolution.

**Q7: What happens if FPO doesn't conduct AGM?**
A: Legal violation. ROC can impose penalties (₹100-5,000). Directors can be disqualified. Always conduct AGM on time.

**Q8: Can non-farmers be directors?**
A: Generally no. Directors should be members (farmers). However, CEO can be non-member professional.

**Q9: What if subsidy application is rejected?**
A: Review rejection reasons. Often: Weak project report, incomplete member verification, unrealistic financials. Fix issues and reapply.

**Q10: How to handle member disputes?**
A: Follow bylaws dispute resolution process. Usually: Internal mediation → Board review → AGM decision → External arbitration if needed.

### Dividend Distribution Formula & Timeline

**What is Dividend?**

Dividend is the share of profit distributed to members based on their shareholding and/or patronage (participation in FPO activities).

**Dividend Distribution Policy:**

```
DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTION FORMULA:

Total Profit Available for Distribution = Net Profit - Reserve Fund (20%) - Contingency Fund (10%)

Example:
Net Profit: ₹1,00,000
Reserve Fund (20%): ₹20,000
Contingency Fund (10%): ₹10,000
Available for Dividend: ₹70,000

DISTRIBUTION METHOD (Choose One):

Method 1: EQUAL DISTRIBUTION (By Shareholding)
- Dividend per share = Available Dividend ÷ Total Shares
- Member dividend = No. of shares × Dividend per share
- Example: ₹70,000 ÷ 20 shares = ₹3,500 per share
- Member with 2 shares gets: ₹7,000

Method 2: PATRONAGE-BASED (By Participation)
- 50% distributed equally (by shares)
- 50% distributed by patronage (milk/produce supplied)
- Example: ₹35,000 equal + ₹35,000 by patronage
- Member who supplied more gets higher dividend

Method 3: HYBRID (Recommended)
- 30% distributed equally (by shares)
- 70% distributed by patronage
- Rewards active members more
- Encourages participation
```

**Dividend Distribution Timeline:**

```
TIMELINE FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENT:

Month 1-3: Financial Year Ends
- Financial year ends (usually March 31)
- Accounts finalized

Month 4-5: Audit & AGM
- Annual audit completed
- AGM held (within 6 months of year-end)
- Members approve dividend distribution
- Board resolution passed

Month 6: Dividend Declaration
- Board declares dividend
- Dividend rate announced
- Member-wise calculation done

Month 7: Dividend Payment
- Dividend paid to members
- Payment via bank transfer (preferred)
- Dividend vouchers issued
- TDS deducted (if applicable, above ₹5,000)

TOTAL TIME: 6-7 months from year-end to payment
```

### Share Redemption Policy (When Member Exits)

**When Can Shares Be Redeemed?**

Shares are redeemed (bought back by FPO) when:
1. Member resigns voluntarily
2. Member dies (succession not possible)
3. Member is expelled (serious violation)
4. Member becomes ineligible (no longer farming)

**Share Redemption Process:**

```
STEP 1: MEMBER RESIGNATION NOTICE
- Member submits written resignation (30-90 days notice)
- Reason for resignation stated
- Outstanding dues (if any) to be cleared

STEP 2: BOARD APPROVAL
- Board reviews resignation at next meeting
- Verifies no outstanding dues
- Approves redemption
- Calculates redemption value

STEP 3: REDEMPTION VALUE CALCULATION
- Book Value = (Total Net Assets ÷ Total Shares) × Member's Shares
- Example: (₹50,000 ÷ 20 shares) × 2 shares = ₹5,000
- OR: Face Value (if FPO is new/not profitable)
- Example: ₹100 × 2 shares = ₹200

STEP 4: PAYMENT
- Redemption amount paid within 30 days of approval
- Share certificate cancelled
- Member removed from register
- Exit certificate issued

STEP 5: REGISTRATION
- Redemption recorded in Share Register
- Member register updated
- Share capital reduced (if applicable)
```

**Share Redemption Formula:**

```
REDEMPTION VALUE = BOOK VALUE (Recommended)

Book Value Calculation:
- Total Net Assets = Total Assets - Total Liabilities
- Book Value per Share = Total Net Assets ÷ Total Outstanding Shares
- Member Redemption = Book Value per Share × Member's Shares

Example:
Total Assets: ₹2,00,000
Total Liabilities: ₹50,000
Net Assets: ₹1,50,000
Total Shares: 20
Book Value per Share: ₹1,50,000 ÷ 20 = ₹7,500 per share
Member with 2 shares: ₹15,000

ALTERNATIVE: FACE VALUE (If FPO is New/Loss-Making)
- Face Value = Original Share Price (₹100)
- Member with 2 shares: ₹200
```

**Member Exit Certificate:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MEMBER EXIT CERTIFICATE
[FPO NAME] FARMER PRODUCER COMPANY LIMITED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

```

---

### Prevention System 1: SEPARATION OF DUTIES

**NO SINGLE PERSON SHOULD:**
- Approve AND authorize payments
- Process bills AND make payment
- Create invoice AND approve it
- Authorize someone AND audit them

**IMPLEMENT:**

```
PAYMENT APPROVAL CHAIN:

Step 1: Bill Received
└─→ Accountant receives vendor invoice
    ├─ Verifies invoice details
    └─ Checks against purchase order

Step 2: Manager Review
└─→ Activity Head (Dairy/Paddy/Sugarcane Manager) reviews
    ├─ Confirms service/goods received
    ├─ Matches invoice to delivery
    └─ Approves or rejects

Step 3: CEO Approval (for expenses > ₹10,000)
└─→ CEO cross-checks
    ├─ Verifies funds available
    ├─ Checks budget limit not exceeded
    └─ Approves or returns for clarification

Step 4: Treasurer Authorization
└─→ Treasurer processes payment
    ├─ Prepares cheque
    └─ Files supporting documents

Step 5: Signatory Sign-off
└─→ Chairman + Treasurer sign cheque
    ├─ Both independently verify
    └─ No cheque signed by one person

Step 6: Bank Processing
└─→ Bank verifies signatures
    └─ Processes payment

RESULT: No single person can manipulate!

Track FPO success, identify issues early, and make data-driven decisions. This section provides Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and monitoring frameworks for FPO management.

---

### Core KPIs for FPO Success

**1. MEMBER SATISFACTION SCORE**

**What to Measure:**
- Member satisfaction with FPO services (1-5 scale)
- Member retention rate (% of members staying year-over-year)
- Member participation rate (% of members actively using FPO services)

**How to Measure:**
```
Quarterly Member Survey:
- Rate FPO services: 1 (Poor) to 5 (Excellent)
- Would you recommend FPO to others? Yes/No
- Are you satisfied with payment timeliness? Yes/No
- Are you satisfied with produce prices? Yes/No

Target: 80%+ satisfaction score
```

**Action if Below Target:**
- Conduct member feedback sessions
- Address specific complaints

**What to Measure:**
- Total FPO revenue ÷ Number of active members
- Revenue growth rate (year-over-year)
- Revenue by activity (dairy, paddy, sugarcane, etc.)

**How to Calculate:**
```
Revenue per Member = Total Annual Revenue ÷ Active Members

Example:
Year 1: ₹50 lakh revenue ÷ 50 members = ₹1 lakh per member
Year 2: ₹75 lakh revenue ÷ 60 members = ₹1.25 lakh per member
Growth: 25% increase per member

Target: ₹1 lakh+ per member by Year 2
```

**Action if Below Target:**
- Increase member participation
- Diversify revenue streams
- Improve pricing strategies
- Expand market linkages

---

**3. SUBSIDY UTILIZATION RATE**

**What to Measure:**
- % of approved subsidies actually utilized
- Time to utilize subsidy (from approval to utilization)
- Subsidy impact on FPO operations

**How to Calculate:**
```
Subsidy Utilization Rate = (Amount Utilized ÷ Amount Approved) × 100

Example:
SFAC Grant Approved: ₹10 lakh
Amount Utilized: ₹8 lakh
Utilization Rate: 80%

Target: 90%+ utilization within 12 months
```

**Action if Below Target:**
- Identify bottlenecks in utilization
- Accelerate project implementation

- Cash flow positive timeline

**How to Calculate:**
```
Break-Even Point = Fixed Costs ÷ (Revenue per Unit - Variable Cost per Unit)

Example:
Fixed Costs: ₹5 lakh/year
Revenue per Member: ₹1 lakh/year
Variable Cost per Member: ₹60,000/year
Contribution Margin: ₹40,000 per member
Break-Even Members: ₹5 lakh ÷ ₹40,000 = 12.5 members (13 members)

Target: Break-even within 18 months
```

**Action if Delayed:**
- Reduce fixed costs
- Increase member base
- Improve operational efficiency
- Review pricing strategy

---

**5. MEMBER GROWTH RATE**

**What to Measure:**

Process: FPO transfers shares to heir (if eligible) OR
         Heir can sell shares back to FPO
Timeline: Process within 90 days of death notification
```

**Succession Process:**

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
MEMBER DEATH - SUCCESSION PROCEDURE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1: NOTIFICATION
Family of deceased member or FPO discovers death:
- Inform Chairman/Secretary immediately
- Provide: Death certificate (photocopy)
- Date of death recorded

STEP 2: IDENTIFY LEGAL HEIR
Legal heir is typically (in order of priority):
1. Spouse (widow/widower)
2. Adult children (male first, then female - traditional interpretation)
3. Parents (if no spouse/children)
4. Siblings (if no above)

Proof required:
- Death certificate (shows deceased's legal heirs)
- Succession certificate (from district court - if disputed)
- OR family affidavit (notarized, if consensual)

STEP 3: OFFER TO LEGAL HEIR
FPO offers to heir:
Option A: Continue membership (take over shares)
Option B: Exit + Refund (return shares to FPO)
Option C: Sell shares (transfer to another existing member)

STEP 4: OPTION A - IF HEIR CONTINUES MEMBERSHIP

Eligibility check:
☐ Is heir a farmer (or farming household)?
☐ Does heir have land/dairy activity?
☐ Different ration card from deceased? ☐
☐ Any criminal record? ☐

If eligible → Board approves
- New member agreement signed by heir
- Share certificate transferred to heir name
- Heir becomes member (same terms as deceased)

STEP 5: OPTION B - IF HEIR WANTS REFUND

Calculation:
a) Original share capital: ₹200
b) Add: Any dividends paid posthumously: ₹[X]
c) Minus: Any outstanding dues: ₹[Y]
d) TOTAL REFUND: ₹[200 + X - Y]

Payment:
- FPO refunds within 30 days
- Bank transfer to heir's account
- Family can provide new account or use deceased's account
- Share certificate cancelled + marked "REFUNDED ON DEATH"

STEP 6: OPTION C - IF HEIR WANTS TO SELL

Heir can transfer shares to:
- Other FPO member (new member willing to buy)
- Or back to FPO (if any buyback policy)

Process: Same as "Share Transfer" (see above)

STEP 7: DOCUMENTATION
Final file content:
- Death certificate (photocopy)
- Succession/legal heir proof
- Board resolution (approving succession or refund)
- New share certificate OR cancellation notice
- Payment receipt (if refund paid)
- Heir signature/consent

RECORD KEEPING:
- Member register: "Status changed to [Continued/Resigned/Transferred]"
- Membership register: "Date of transition: [date]"
- Files kept for 10 years minimum

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

---

### PART D: DISPUTE RESOLUTION (Share-Related)

**What If Heir Disagrees or There's Conflict?**

```
SCENARIO 1: Family disputes who the legal heir is
RESOLUTION:
- Get succession certificate from district court
- OR submit family agreement (signed by all potential heirs) + notarization
- FPO holds shares pending resolution (typically 90 days)
- Legal heirs must resolve externally, not FPO's role

SCENARIO 2: Heir rejects membership but other family members want to join
RESOLUTION:
- If "one member per family" rule applies, can't have multiple
- Family must choose 1 representative
- Others can join FPO only if separate ration cards

SCENARIO 3: Heir wants to continue but not eligible (not farmer)
RESOLUTION:
- Heir can keep shares but can't participate actively
- Shares become "non-participating" (draw dividends only)
- OR heir must sell shares to eligible member
- 60-day deadline to either convert or sell

## ANNEX-6: TELUGU LANGUAGE FARMER HANDOUTS ✨

### ONE-PAGE HANDOUT 1: WHAT IS AN FPO? (Simple Telugu)

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
సంगీకృత కృషक సంస్థ (FPO) ఎంటిది?
FARMER PRODUCER ORGANIZATION - సులభ వివరణ
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FPO అంటే: సంगీకృత కృషక సంస్థ (ఒకే ఆలోచనలో ఉన్న రైతుల సమూహం)

🌾 కన్నీ తెలిపే ఉదాహరణ:

ఒంటరిగా చేసిన ఏమీ చేయలేము, కానీ కలిసి చేయగలం.

- ఒంటరి రైతు = తక్కువ ధర, ఎక్కువ సమస్యలు
- [DrawBox] కలిసిన FPO = ఎక్కువ ధర, తక్కువ సమస్యలు

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FPO లాభాలు (సమూహం ఎందుకు మంచిది?):

1. 🛒 సమ్మిళిత కొనుగోలు (Joint Buying)
   - విత్తనాలు, సారాలు, రసాయనాలు చేప ధరకు కొనండి
   - ఏకరుడు కొంటే: ₹1,200/20 కిలోలు
   - FPO ద్వారా కొంటే: ₹900/20 కిలోలు = ₹300 సేవ!

2. 💰 సరిపోయిన ధర (Fair Price)
   - మీ పంటను నేరుగా విక్రయించండి (మధ్యస్తుడు లేకుండా)
   - మార్కెట్ ధర: ₹2,500/100 కిలోలు
   - మధ్యస్థ నష్టం: ₹500
   - FPO నుండి: ₹2,300/100 కిలోలు = రేకీ మీకు!

3. 🚜 ఉపయోగపడే సేవలు
   - ట్రాక్టర్ కూడిక కిరాయిపై
   - తిరిగిపంట పరीక్ష
   - ప్రక్రియాభిరుచి (ఉదా: అరిసి యంత్రం)

4. 💳 ఋణ సువిధలు
   - ఋణాలు పొందటం సులభమైనది (ఎక్కువ మందితుల ధర కారణంగా)
   - కిమర్ చే కవరేజ్ బీమా

5. 🎓 శిక్షణ & జ్ఞానం
   - ఫసలు సంరక్షణ కోర్సు
   - ఆధুనిక వ్యవసాయ పద్ధతులు
   - చెడు వాతావరణానికి సిద్ధమని

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FPO లో చేరటానికి ఎవరు అర్హులు?

✅ చేర్చుకోవచ్చు:
- సక్రియ రైతులు
- నిజమైన భూమి రికార్డ్‌లు ఉన్నవారు
- గోపాల రైతులు (పశువుల పెంపకం)
- 18+ ఏళ్ల వయస్సు

❌ చేర్చుకోలేరు:
- నకిలీ భూమి రికార్డ్‌లు
- తీవ్ర నేమిక కేసులు
- బిజిసం చేసే వ్యాపారులు
- గిరిజన నుండి చేరుకున్న వారు

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

"ఒక కుటుంబం = ఒక సభ్యుడు" నియమం

ఇందర్నీ నిఘంటువు? = ఒక కుటుంబానికి ఒకే ఒక సభ్యుడు FPOలో ఉండాలి

✅ తండ్రి చేరుకోవచ్చు = తనకు కూటమి:
✅ కుమారుడు చేరుకోవచ్చు = కూటమి వేరుగా ఉంటే

❌ తండ్రి & కుమారుడు ఇద్దరూ చేరలేరు = ఒకే కూటమిలో

= ఎందుకంటే: ఒక రాషన్ కార్డ్ = ఒక కుటుంబం

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

సభ్యుడిలో చేరటానికి ఏ పత్రాలు వద్దు?

1. ✅ ఆధార్ కార్డ్
2. ✅ రేషన్ కార్డ్
3. ✅ భూమి రికార్డ్ (ROR-1B / Adangal) - MeeBhoomi నుండి కూడా
4. ✅ బ్యాంక్ పասు
5. ✅ చెక్ కుటుంబ ఫోటోను

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

మీరు చేసిన అధ్యక్షుడుకు ప్రశ్నలు?

Q: FPOలో చేర్చుకోవటానికి ఎంత డబ్బు వెచ్చించాలి?
A: సభ్యులు సంఖ్య = ₹100-200 (ఒకసారిగా), ఎప్పటికీ అదిపోకుండా
   ఇతర సేవలకు చెల్లింపు = సీక్షణ తర్వాత మాత్రమే

Q: FPOకు వెళ్ళటానికి ఏ నిబంధనలున్నాయి?
A: సభ్యులను నిమిషానికి నిర్ణయించుకోలేదు.
   తప్పిపోయిన విషయానికీ చెప్పటానికి FPO అధ్యక్షుడిని సంప్రదించండి.

Q: లాభాలు ఎప్పుడు వస్తాయి?
A: సంవత్సరానికి ఒకసారి (వార్షిక సమావేశం తర్వాత లాభం చెప్పబడుతుంది)
