- Market products directly to buyers
- Reduce costs and increase profitability for members

### Legal Structure
FPOs can be registered under multiple laws:
- **Producer Company** (Most common - RECOMMENDED)

```

---

### Prevention System 1: SEPARATION OF DUTIES

**NO SINGLE PERSON SHOULD:**
- Approve AND authorize payments
- Process bills AND make payment
- Create invoice AND approve it
- Authorize someone AND audit them

**IMPLEMENT:**

```
PAYMENT APPROVAL CHAIN:

Step 1: Bill Received
└─→ Accountant receives vendor invoice
    ├─ Verifies invoice details
    └─ Checks against purchase order

Step 2: Manager Review
└─→ Activity Head (Dairy/Paddy/Sugarcane Manager) reviews
    ├─ Confirms service/goods received
    ├─ Matches invoice to delivery
    └─ Approves or rejects

Step 3: CEO Approval (for expenses > ₹10,000)
└─→ CEO cross-checks
    ├─ Verifies funds available
    ├─ Checks budget limit not exceeded
    └─ Approves or returns for clarification

Step 4: Treasurer Authorization
└─→ Treasurer processes payment
    ├─ Prepares cheque
    └─ Files supporting documents

Step 5: Signatory Sign-off
└─→ Chairman + Treasurer sign cheque
    ├─ Both independently verify
    └─ No cheque signed by one person

Step 6: Bank Processing
└─→ Bank verifies signatures
    └─ Processes payment

RESULT: No single person can manipulate!
```
